# Graphics-Demo

##### This demonstration software illustrates movement of an object on a textured Catmill-Rom spline. 
##### It is by no means a finished project, but more of a demo of the concept. 
##### It also shows shading techniques - day/night, realistic/toon colours.
##### Demonstrated are also camera types - first person (slight clipping, easily fixable with the model ship removed), third person, and top-down view.
##### For some visual variety around the track there are also mesh-based object, which demonstrate rotation and scaling, and some primitives-based objects (coded and textured by me, textures also made by me)
##### Feel free to look around by pressing U to unlock the camera and fly by anywhere!


## Controls:

##### W/S - Go faster/stop
##### K/L - toggle day/night shader
##### M/N - toggle toon shader on/off
##### F - first person camera
##### T - third
##### O - top down 
##### U - unocked camera (for debugging, but use it to look around the scenery)
##### Note: V/B - toggle UI, unimplemented
